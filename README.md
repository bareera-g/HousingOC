## 📌 Problem

Orange County is one of the least affordable rental markets in the United States. Many residents — particularly in areas like Santa Ana and Anaheim — face barriers accessing housing assistance, understanding eligibility criteria, or finding roommates to share costs. Existing resources are fragmented, outdated, and not user-friendly.
